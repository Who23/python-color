# python-color

It's python3, but it has syntax highlighting in the REPL!

## To use:
1. Clone the repo wherever you want
2. Run `setup.sh CONFIG_FILE` where CONFIG_FILE is your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
3. You're ready to use `python-color`! 

* Giving `python-color` an argument will run that file with `python3`
* Running it w/o an argument will run the REPL

python-color is meant for macOS
